# HMC_Brucite
Save the MATLAB file ”HMC_Public” and the MATLAB data file “LOOK_UP_HMC_Pub” in the same folder. 
The MATLAB data file contains the values of solid density, fluid density and mass fraction of MgO as function of fluid pressure; as shown in figure 1C and D in the manuscript.
Open the file ”HMC_Public” in MATLAB and run the file.
A figure will be displayed which shows the evolution of the numerical errors with progressive pseudo-transient iterations. The simulation will end after ca. 16’000 iterations and will show in a second figure the results for the first time step of the simulation shown in figure 7 of the corresponding manuscript.
